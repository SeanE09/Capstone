## Business Understanding
We were tasked with building a Neural Network model for the purposes of recognizing handwritten letters/number and converting them to text. 

## Business Applications
1. The post office - helping to identify the handwritten addresses on mail items
2. Converting historical medical records over to text files for record keeping and future meta-analysis
3. Historical Censes and government records for record keeping and future meta-analysis
4. Handwriting software for taken handwritten notes and converting them to a text file of notes
